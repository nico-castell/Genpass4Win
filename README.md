This program is a password generator for Windows systems built using the
[Universal Windows Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide),
which allows for the creation of a GUI that integrates seamlessly with the system theme, wether its light or dark.

<h2 align="center">How to use</h2>

The GUI is pretty simple, with just a few buttons and checkboxes.

There is a password length selector, identifiable as the box with **+** and **-** right beside it.
You can write a number into this box or use the **+** and **-** buttons. (If you type an invalid
number or letters, the value will be set back to what it was next time you generate a password).

There is a group of 3 checkboxes to control if you want **letters**, **numbers** and/or **symbols**
in your password.

Last, but not least, there are two buttons on the bottom right corner, the upper one to generate
the password, and the bottom one to copy it to the clipboard.

Above the **generate password** button there is a checkbox to control if the generated password is
hidden or visible.
